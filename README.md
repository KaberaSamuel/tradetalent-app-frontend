# 🧑‍💻 My Service Exchange App (The Frontend Part)

This is the code for the website part (the frontend) of my Service Exchange project.

## 🌟 What This App Does

This app is a provides a simple way to trade services without using any money! It's like a modern barter system for skills and services.

**The main idea is simple:**
You post a service you need done, and you offer a skill you can use to pay for it.

### **Quick Example:**

- **You need:** A new landing page website built for your business.
- **You offer:** To do video editing for someone else's product.

It's all about trading one talent for another!

## 🛠️ Tech Stuff I Used

I built this using a few popular tools. They help make the app fast and easier to keep track of as it gets bigger.

| Part of the App    | What I Used        | A simple reason why I used it                                                                      |
| :----------------- | :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Language**       | **TypeScript**     | It enforces code maintainability and safety (Now I can't go back to javascript 😅)                 |
| **Main UI**        | **React**          | To build the UIs using small, reusable components.                                                 |
| **Styling/Look**   | **Tailwind CSS**   | Makes styling super fast and responsive without writing a lot of custom CSS.                       |
| **Managing State** | **Redux**          | To keep all the app's state in respective slices and access it anywhere.                           |
| **Fetching Data**  | **Tanstack Query** | Easily Handles caching, data synchronization, and background fetching. (I wish I used it earlier!) |
| **Real-time Chat** | **WebSockets**     | To handle instant messaging in the chat system.                                                    |
| **API Calls**      | **Axios**          | Makes interacting with backend api easy.                                                           |
